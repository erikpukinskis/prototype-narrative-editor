Narrative
---------

Narrative lets you write code the way you'd write stories. It encourages you to break the different parts of a big application into self-contained, self-explanatory chunks, and arrange those chunks in sequence, like chapters in a book.

I'm trying to write Narrative—the tool for editing and running software narratives—as a narrative. You can see it in [narrative.md](narrative.md).
